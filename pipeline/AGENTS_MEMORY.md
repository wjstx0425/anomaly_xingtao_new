## Cropped six-view PatchCore retraining

- `run_patchcore_roi_six_views.sh` is the minimal user-run entrypoint.
- Defaults: data `dataset/zs32_patchcore_roi`, output `results/six_view_roi_fixed_seed42`, GPU `0`, and `HF_HUB_OFFLINE=1`.
- It verifies `crop_manifest.csv`, then reuses `run_wrn50_fixed_six_views.sh` for serial, resumable right-side six-view PatchCore training with the existing fixed seed-42 configuration.
- Run from the repository root with `bash pipeline/run_patchcore_roi_six_views.sh`.
- Before the directory-preserving recrop, all old training processes/services and old ROI results were stopped/removed. The regenerated dataset contains 2010 images, preserves every original hand/view directory, and records zero corrected views. Start retraining fresh with the runner.

## C789 grayscale multi-template matcher prototype

- `train_template_matcher.py` and `predict.py` implement a standalone OpenCV image-level baseline; they are not part of the numbered pipeline and do not use anomalib `Engine` or checkpoints.
- Training groups already-cropped images by `left_top|left_bottom` and `slotNN`. It selects representative normal templates using a median prototype plus farthest-first thumbnail sampling.
- Matching uses grayscale resize, a `3x3` Gaussian blur, and `cv2.TM_CCOEFF_NORMED` over a reflected `+-shift` translation window. The score is the maximum similarity across a slot's templates; lower than the group threshold means `defect`.
- The default `normal_quantile=0.995` produces a lower-tail threshold at quantile `0.005` from the same `normal_test` images later included in metrics. Those normal metrics are calibration-set results, not an independent test estimate; a missing `normal_test` group silently falls back to `0.8`.
- Outputs are `dataset_index.csv`, template PNGs, `model.json`, `predictions.csv`, and `metrics.json`. `predict.py` requires an already-cropped image plus explicit `--view` and `--slot` and prints one JSON result.
- Keep this baseline distinct from the canonical stage 11-15 geometry workflow in `capture_data/geometry_shape.py`: this prototype compares whole-image grayscale appearance and produces one binary score, while geometry templates compare aligned masks and produce interpretable `missing_mask` / `extra_mask` evidence.
- Known prototype boundaries: no ROI/slot detection, no defect localization/type, no dedicated README/tests/config, no friendly checks for missing groups/templates, direct aspect-ratio coercion on shape mismatch, and direct-script-only import style for `predict.py`.
